### Hi there 👋 My name is Christopher Ross.

#### About me
I am a recent graduate from Seattle University with a dual-degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

From October 2009 to Feburary 2015 I served in the United States Air Force. I spent the majority of my enlisted time stationed at Offutt AFB, NE where I flew on the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) as maintainer and operator of the aircrafts various communications systems. Equipment capabilities varried from radios operating from VLF to EHF, analog modems, T1, fiber, and modern TCP/IP networks with physical and logical barriers for different classification levels.

While at Seattle University I worked with faculty and peers on several projects. My undergraduate thesis for applied mathematics is where a considerable amount of hours were invested into nonlinear water wave research outside of class hours. For my computer science senior project, I worked with three other peers to assist the vice-president of supplier quality to implement a knowledgebase system to track and enforce best practices across offices and remote sites. My data modeling and visualizations courses assisted the local non-profits El Centro de la Raza and Real Change to consolidate data, use statistical models to address business goals, and visualize consolidated information using various statistics on customer trends.
